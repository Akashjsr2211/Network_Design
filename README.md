# 🌐 Network Design & Configuration Showcase

Welcome to my collection of network design and configuration projects! This repository includes detailed topologies, configuration files, and snapshots of real or simulated networks built using tools like **Cisco Packet Tracer**, **GNS3**, and more.

## 📁 What’s Inside

- 📸 **Network Diagrams** – Visual representations of network layouts and topologies  
- 📄 **Configuration Files** – Router, switch, and other device configs  
- ⚙️ **Simulation Files** – Packet Tracer `.pkt` files or GNS3 project files  
- 📝 **Documentation** – Setup steps, IP planning, device roles, and more

## 🚀 Projects Included

| Project Name           | Description                                     | Tool Used        |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Basic LAN Setup        | Simple LAN with DHCP, DNS, and File Server      | Cisco Packet Tracer |
| Router-on-a-Stick VLAN | VLAN setup with inter-VLAN routing              | Cisco Packet Tracer |
| WAN Topology           | Branch-to-branch communication with OSPF/BGP    | GNS3             |

> New designs and updates are added regularly!
